This program we use for calculate square, volume and ratio volume of pyramids.

Using technologies: TestNG, Log4j2, Java STREAM API.

Input data in file: two points(six number, it is x ,y and z coordinates),
height main pyramid, height on which we should create new polygon
and number of basis angels.

Sequence: two points, number of basis angels, height main pyramid and height
polygon.

Code written in Java Code Convention with plugins "CheckStyle" and "SonarLint".

For calculate different moments in this application i used different
mathematical formulas which found in the internet and mathematical books.

When are you running all the tests, only the first 27 tests is starting up
first, because these tests don't have priority. The next you should run test
in signature package.
